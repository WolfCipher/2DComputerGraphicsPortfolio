# Portfolio 1 for Honors CS559, Spring 2025

There are three main parts to this portfolio.
1) Feed the Beagle page
2) Train page
3) Boids page

## Feed the Beagle
- Graphics that respond to click events:   clicking the food bag starts an animation!
- Actions that take time to unfold:   the eating animation!
- Many objects moving at once:   the different body parts of the dog move
- Sets of graphical objects that come and go:   the food bag disappears and reappears
- Non-trivial 2D Canvas animation:   the eating animation!
- Multiple animated hierarchical objects:   the body parts of the dog
- Use of basic transformations:   translated and rotated the dog for the animation; scaled the bone design on the dog bowl

## Train
- Many objects moving at once:   the different sections of the train move individually
- Non-trivial 2D Canvas animation:   the train's motion requires curves
- Use of basic transformations:   the train is translated and rotated
- A complex curve through multiple points   the train track
- An object that moves along the complex curve and orients itself appropriately:   the train itself
- Arc length parameterization:   constant train speed and rail ties

## Boids
- Many objects moving at once:   the boids move individually
- Non-trivial 2D Canvas animation:   the boids bounce off the edges
- Use of basic transformations:   translated and rotated the boids
- An SVG that uses instancing, arcs, and curves:   there is an arc in the boids' tails, a curve in the boids' wings, and <use> tags are used for the boids' wings.

*This set of web pages forms a "workbook" assignment for 
CS559, Computer Graphics at the University of Wisconsin for Spring 2025.*

Students should run a local web server and start with the `index.html` page.
The html files may not work as "files" without a local server.

Information about the class is available on the course web:

The `for_students` sub-directory contains files for the students to read and
modify. 

The `libs` sub-directory contains libraries used by the workbook. These
have separate open source licenses provided in the directories. 

The workbook content was primarily developed by Prof. Michael Gleicher with
assistance from the course staff, including Young Wu, over the years.

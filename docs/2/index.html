            <p>In this program, a train moves along a track.
                The user can start and stop the train and determine the design of the track and the train. For example, the user
                determines whether the track is represented by a simple curve or looks like an actual track.
                The user also determines how many cabooses the train has and whether the train releases smoke (or is environmentally friendly).
            </p>
            <p>
                The user can also turn arc-length parameterization on and off. This affects
                the train's speed and the rail ties. Finally, the tension of the cardinal spline defining the track
                can be set between -1 and 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite part of this project is the ability to control the number of cabooses. I am proud that I found a way
                to iterate through a list of cabooses and draw them in the correct position and orientation rather than draw 
                each caboose individually, which would limit the number of cabooses drawn. Technically, my code could
                work with any number of cabooses and the limited range of the slider is arbitrary.
            </p>
            <p>This applies the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Many objects moving at once:</strong> &nbsp; the different sections of the train move individually</li>
                <li><strong>Non-trivial 2D Canvas animation:</strong> &nbsp; the train's motion requires curves</li>
                <li><strong>Use of basic transformations:</strong> &nbsp; the train is translated and rotated</li>
                <li><strong>A complex curve through multiple points</strong> &nbsp; the train track</li>
                <li><strong>An object that moves along the complex curve and orients itself appropriately:</strong> &nbsp; the train itself</li>
                <li><strong>Arc length parameterization:</strong> &nbsp; constant train speed and rail ties</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In this program, you can feed a beagle. By clicking the food bag, an animation begins---the 
                dog eats the food. You can feed the beagle as many times as you wish!</p>
            <p>
                This was my most ambitious project of the portfolio. Getting the right curves to draw the dog's body was 
                challenging, and I needed to make edits to the designs after I began work on the animation to ensure no 
                "weird spots" would appear. I do not believe I could have created these designs without experience in animation puppeting, 
                though my experience was with tools like Adobe Animate and not with coding the puppet myself.
                In my experience, the effort put into creating a good animation puppet is often underestimated, so I would just like
                to emphasize that there was a lot of thought put into this.
                Finally, coding the transitions between each position (sit, stand, eat) also took
                time to think through and a lot of debugging.
            </p>
            <p>This applies the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Graphics that respond to click events:</strong> &nbsp; clicking the food bag starts an animation!</li>
                <li><strong>Actions that take time to unfold:</strong> &nbsp; the eating animation!</li>
                <li><strong>Many objects moving at once:</strong> &nbsp; the different body parts of the dog move</li>
                <li><strong>Sets of graphical objects that come and go:</strong> &nbsp; the food bag disappears and reappears</li>
                <li><strong>Non-trivial 2D Canvas animation:</strong> &nbsp; the eating animation!</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple animated hierarchical objects:</strong> &nbsp; the body parts of the dog</li>
                <li><strong>Use of basic transformations:</strong> &nbsp; translated and rotated the dog for the animation; scaled the bone design on the dog bowl</li>
            </ul>
